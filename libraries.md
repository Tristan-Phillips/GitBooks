Libraries
---------
    - Libraries are a collection of code that is used to perform a specific task.
    - Libraries are used to make programming easier.
    - Libraries also allow for code to be reused.
    - Libraries are also known as modules or packages.

    QT has a lot of libraries that are used to create a GUI application.
    - QtCore 
        - This library contains the core non-GUI functionality (e.g., strings, basic data structures, streams, shared memory, etc.).
    - QtGui 
        - This library contains the classes that enable us to create a GUI application. 
        - It contains the classes that allow us to draw shapes, create windows, and handle events.
    - QtWidgets - This library allows for widgets to be created and used in the application. 
        - It contains the classes that allow us to create buttons, text boxes, and other widgets.
    - QtNetwork - This library allows for network communication.
        - It contains the classes that allow us to create a server and client.
    - QtSql - This library allows for database communication.
        - It contains the classes that allow us to create a database and connect to it.
    - QtXml - This library allows for XML communication.
        - It contains the classes that allow us to create XML files and read them.
    - QtSvg - This library allows for SVG communication.
        - It contains the classes that allow us to create SVG files and read them.
        - SVG is a vector image format.
    - QtMultimedia - This library allows for multimedia communication.
        - It contains the classes that allow us to create a multimedia player and connect to it.
        - Such as audio and video.
        - It also contains the classes that allow us to create a camera and connect to it.
    - QtWebSockets - This library allows for web sockets communication.
        - It contains the classes that allow us to create a web socket server and client.
    - QtWebChannel - This library allows for web channel communication.
        - It contains the classes that allow us to create a web channel server and client.
        - A web channel is a way to communicate between a web application and a Qt application.
    - QtWebEngine - This library allows for web engine communication.
        - A web engine allows you to access the web from within your application.
    - QtWebEngineCore - This library allows for web engine core communication.
        - A web engine core differs from a web engine in that it is a lower level of the web engine and allows for more control over the web engine.
    - QtWebEngineWidgets - This library allows for web engine widgets to be created and used in the application.
        - A web engine widget is a web engine that is displayed in a widget.
        - It is a web engine that is displayed in a window that is a widget.
    - QtConcurrent - This library allows for concurrent communication.
        - Concurrent communication is communication that is done in parallel.
        - It is communication that is done at the same time.
        - It is communication that is done in multiple threads.
    - QtBluetooth - This library allows for bluetooth communication.
        - It contains the classes that allow us to create a bluetooth server and client.
    - QtPositioning - This library allows for positioning communication.
        - Positioning communication is communication that is done with a GPS.
    - QtSerialPort - This library allows for serial port communication.
    - QtSerialBus - This library allows for serial bus communication.
    - QtNfc - This library allows for NFC communication.
        - NFC communication is communication that is done with a NFC chip.
    - QtSensors - This library allows for sensors communication.
    - QtLocation - This library allows for location communication.
    - QtScript - This library allows for script communication.
        - Scripts are a way to write code in a different language.

    And many more...
