## Question 1

1.1 Name and describe five of the goals of usability briefly

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

1. **Effectiveness** - How good a product is at doing what it is supposed to do
2. **Efficiency** – refers to the way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks, e.g. fewer steps to accomplish things
3. **Safety** – To make interactive products safer in this sense involves \
   1\) preventing the user from making serious errors by reducing the risk of wrong keys/buttons being mistakenly activated (e.g. not placing the quit or delete-file command right next to the save command on a menu) and \
   2\) providing users with various means of recovery should the make errors. Undo functionality
4. **Utility** – refers to the extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to
5. **Learnability** – refers to how easy a system is to learn and use. Pop-up tutorials can help with more complex systems but ideally people should be able to become more competent without a lot of effort
6. **Memorability** – refers to how easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned. Especially important for products that are used infrequently

1.2 Evaluate the usability of a typical music streaming application by providing one positive or negative comment regarding each of the goals that you described above.

Use the following table format for your answer

| Point | 1.1 Usability goals | 1.2 Evaluation of music app                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a     | Effectiveness       | Navigation on music app can be a bit clumsy/cumber stone: The user must go back to search button to see other songs on the list                                                                      |
| b     | Safety              | The app prevents the user from making serious errors, or allows the user to recover from serious errors                                                                                              |
| c     | Utility             | The music app enables the user to do and submit                                                                                                                                                      |
| d     | Learnability        | After downloading the music app, a first-time user can easily start using the app                                                                                                                    |
| e     | Memorability        | Since music apps follow a standardized format and structure for all modules, it is quite easy to remember how to use the system for other modules once you have learned how to use it for one module |

## Question 2

Assume that you have been asked to plan the lifecycle of the interactive design for a local town’s electronic library system

2.1 List and explain three basic but essential activities of interaction design

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

* **Establishing Requirements** – Know who target users are and what kind of support an interactive product could usefully provide. These needs form the basis of the product’s requirements and underpin subsequent design and development. Est requirements is fundamental to a user-centered approach and very important in interaction design. Understanding the needs is established through data gathering and analysis
* **Designing Alternatives** – This is the core activity of designing and actually involves suggesting ideas for meeting the requirements. It can be viewed as 2 sub-activities: conceptual and concrete design. Conceptual design involves producing the conceptual model for the product and a conceptual model describes an abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Concrete design considers the detail of the product including the colors, sounds, and images to use, menu design, and icon design. Alternatives are considered at every point
* **Prototyping** – Interaction design involves designing interactive products. Most sensible way for users to evaluate such designs is to interact with it, and this can be achieved through prototyping. Different prototyping techniques exist, but not all require a working piece of software
* **Evaluating** – This is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design that is measured in terms of a variety of usability and user experience criteria. Interaction design requires a high level of user involvement throughout development, and this enhances the chances of an acceptable product being delivered. Evaluation does not replace the activities concerned with quality assurance and testing to make sure that the final product is fit for purpose, but it complements and enhances then

</details>

2.2 Apply these activities to the electronic library system mentioned above

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

1. Establishing requirements: librarians and library users’ needs should underpin the subsequent design, e.g. what would users like to be able to view online in the library catalogue?
2. Designing alternatives: after data gathering regarding the needs, the interaction designer should compile a conceptual design that shows the various activities (lending a book, returning a book, browsing the catalogue, etc.) and the relations between these facilities.
3. Prototyping: the programming team could be asked to design examples of the various screens for the planned system (without) any functionality, e.g. a non-functional collection of screens that demonstrate how a student will lend a digital book from the Unisa library
4. Evaluating: users can be asked to give feedback on the conceptual model or prototype before detailed coding of the functionality starts, e.g. getting a group of librarians to critically discuss the nonfunctional collection of screens that demonstrate how a student will lend a digital book from the Unisa library

</details>

## Question 3

3.1 Discuss the purpose of conceptual models

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

A conceptual model provides a working strategy and a framework of general concepts and their interrelations which describes at a high level how a system is organized and operates. It is used by the design team as the basis from which to develop more detailed and concrete aspects of the design

</details>

3.2 Discuss the core components of conceptual models

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

* **Metaphors and analogies** that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity (e.g. browsing and bookmarking)
* **The concepts** that people are exposed to through the product, including the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them (e.g. saving, organizing)
* **The relationships** between those concepts (e.g. whether one object contains another and the relative importance of actions to others)
* **The mappings** between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (e.g. one can revisit through looking at a list of visited sites, most frequently visited, or saved websites)

</details>

3.3 Apply the core components of conceptual models to a typical music streaming application

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

**Metaphors and analogies**-The music App must use a (analogy/metaphor), i.e. it must have an easier, user- friendly way to inform users e.g. The Music App provides short snippets of useful information. This appears on and moves across the screen in the way people would expect a real card to do - in a lightweight, paper-based sort of way.&#x20;

**The concepts to which people are exposed through the product** \
The music app has an option/button and make a trumpet sound whenever a new notification is pushed to the user’s phone.&#x20;

**The relationships between those concepts** - Mappings between the concepts and the UX the product is designed support or invoke - The user can easily browse to any type of music they prefer from hip pop, gospels, old school , jazz – thus providing a user-friendly and effective interface and a positive UX. This solves users’ need because all music genre is on one app

## Question 4

Assume that you have been hired by a company that produces fitness trackers. You have to propose ways to create a satisfying experience for users of a new fitness-tracking device

4.1 With reference to emotional interaction, name five design elements that can evoke positive emotions from users (such as pleasurable interfaces)

4.2 Suggest ways in which these concepts could be implemented in the interaction design of the new device

Use the following table format for your answer

| 4.1 Positive design elements / pleasurable interfaces                                                                      | 4.2 Possible implementations of positive design elements for a new fitness tracker                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design at the behavioral level (good usability) and reflective level (product has meaning and personal value for the user) | (good usability) and reflective level (product has meaning and personal value for the user)                                                              |
| Feedback-level Expressive interfaces                                                                                       | communicate status of a system efficiently to provide reassuring feedback                                                                                |
| Persuasive level anthropomorphism - simulating human attributes to make technology more fun                                | <p>Simulating animal attributes to motivate people or to put them in a good mood. <br>Badly designed interfaces that make people frustrated or angry</p> |
| Mood elements                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                          |
| Visceral design products                                                                                                   | The fitness app should look, feel and sound good. Badly designed interfaces make people frustrated or angry                                              |

## Question 5

Several e-readers for reading e-books, watching movies or viewing pictures are available on the market. The exact design differs between models but they all support book reading that is intended to be as comfortable as reading a paper book. The developers of a new e-reader want to find out how appealing an e-reader would be to senior citizens over 65 years of age. To this end, they have asked you to conduct some interviews for them. You are required to answer the following questions in preparation for the interview:

5.1 What is the goal of your data gathering session?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

To learn information about users, their behavior, or their reaction to how appealing an e-reader would be to senior citizens over 65 years of age

</details>

5.2 List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the data during the interview.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

* Observations
* Questionnaires
* Interviews

</details>

5.3 What would be the disadvantages of taking notes during the interviews?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

It is hard to jot down everything a source says, especially if they are a fast talker

Getting word-for-word accurate quotes is nearly impossible with just a pen and paper. Notes will have to be typed up later, costing you time

</details>

5.4 Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals regarding this task

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

What are the services do you expect?&#x20;

What do you think about E reading book?&#x20;

Can you tell us about your experience when using E reading book reader?&#x20;

Which age do you think should read from e-books?

</details>

## Question 6

Assume that you have been contracted by Unisa to do a usability testing of its online registration system. Explain which measures you will put in place to ensure that the participants’ rights are protected

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

a) Usability testing in a controlled setting reduces outside influences and distractions. online registration system – this will allow me to observe certain behaviors&#x20;

b) Other data collection methods can be used, such as interviews and questionnaires I will confirm my observations and analysis using structured interviews with a second group of Students who should also be using online registration system themselves&#x20;

c) Users are required to perform typical tasks to test whether the system does what it is supposed to – I will ask users to do interval training of submitting assignments while evaluating how efficient the online registration system tracker/system tracks online assignments&#x20;

d) Users’ reactions to the interactive product can reveal usability issues that could be missed in other experiments and reports– I will ask a team of students to observe the online registration system and to ask to follow up questions when they express joy or frustration while using online registration system&#x20;

e) When there is more than one way to conduct a certain task, participants could be asked to perform all of these to evaluate which one is the best or the fastest. I will ask the students to use three various kinds online to measure online registration system accuracy for the various types to adjust the algorithm where necessary.

## Question 7

7.1 List five of the ten Nielsen heuristics (usability principles) that can be used to do a usability inspection of user interfaces

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

1. **Visibility of system status** – The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time
2. **Match between system and the real world** – The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order
3. **User control and freedom** – Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog. Support undo and redo
4. **Consistency and standards** – Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions
5. **Error prevention** – Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action
6. **Recognition rather than recall** – Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialog to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use** – Accelerators – unseen by the novice user – may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design** – Dialogs should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialog competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** – Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution
10. **Help and documentation** – Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large

</details>

7.2 Formulate one question that could be asked to test whether the interface of the Unisa library system conforms to these tried and tested heuristics

| Point | 7.1 Heuristic                   | 7.1 Questions that could be asked to test whether the interface of the Unisa library system conforms to these heuristics |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| a     | Help and Documentation          | Through the Unisa library system are you able to easily search assignments, modules, additional materials?               |
| b     | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | The students are they able to check                                                                                      |
| c     | Recognition rather than recall  | Are the instructions visible or easily retrievable                                                                       |
| d     | Error prevention                | Are there any confirmation options                                                                                       |
| e     | User control and freedom        | The re-do buttons are they available on the Unisa library system when a student selected the wrong book                  |
