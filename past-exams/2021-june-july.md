Answer all questions in this section. Choose the correct answer and write it on your answer sheet. Each question carries 2 marks

1.1. Which definition of interaction design is correct?

1. The extent to which a product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they want to do
2. **Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday lives**
3. Ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction or interpretation that can take place at a given moment
4. How good a product is at doing what it is supposed to do

1.2. The fact that myUnisa follows a standardized format and structure for all modules implies that the following usability goal has been met

1. Efficiency
2. Utility
3. Safety
4. **Memorability**

1.3. Assume that you have been contracted to do the interactive design for a local town’s electronic library system. You have designed a non-functional collection of screens that demonstrate how a library user will borrow a digital book. This activity is an example of

1. Visceral design
2. Designing alternatives
3. **Prototyping**
4. Establishing requirements

1.4. Integrating interaction design with an agile software development approach is useful because:

1. **An agile approach incorporates tight iterations, feedback and collaboration with the customer**
2. By using an agile approach, developers can start coding immediately to save time and costs
3. An agile approach does not require that all critical design elements are captured in a design document
4. An agile approach requires all software development processes to be specified before development begins to ensure rigors

1. How future scenarios (visions) enable users to interact with information in their everyday lives
2. How conceptual models provide scenarios of how society can use future generations of imagined technologies
3. How theories help identify factors relevant to the design and evaluation of interactive products
4. **How seemingly similar tasks can have quite different conceptual models and metaphors underlying their design**

1.6. People are inherently social. How have various digital technologies enabled us to overcome social distance, even while physical distancing measures have been in place during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown?

1. Face-to-face meetings have been replaced to a large extent by online meetings using sound and video, or sound only
2. Much informal verbal communication has been replaced by texting and using emojis
3. Creating, sending and forwarding humoristic video and sound clips have replaced the telling of jokes to relief stress and anxiety
4. **All of the above**

1.7. Pilot studies are used to:

1. Study user experience of the digital instruments used by airplane pilots
2. **Do a small trial of the main study to make sure that the proposed research method is viable**

2. The system responsibility includes a menu of various exercises while the user intention includes starting and ending workout sessions
3. The scenario lists a generalized use case showing a detailed set of the specific steps
4. The scenario is rendered in technical terms, e.g. the fitness app tracks the speed, duration and number of steps, calculates the average heart rate and stores the data in the cloud-based database

1.9. The following are appropriate usability goal requirements for an interactive app that will locate places in a shopping center and provide routes for users to reach their destinations:

1. The app needs to access the GPS location data for the user, have maps of the center and requires knowledge about pathways for disabled people
2. The app should be cognitively stimulating for potential groups of users with different characteristics
3. The app must be satisfying, helpful and enhance sociability amongst users
4. **New users must be able to use it immediately, efficiently and safely**

1.10 Which definition of “hypothesis” below is correct within the context of conducting experiments during evaluation design?

1. **A hypothesis is a guess or prediction about the way users will perform with an interface**
2. A hypothesis is a t-test that validates a guess or prediction about the way users will perform with an interface
3. A hypothesis reveals if the differences between experiments conducted in different conditions are significant
4. A hypothesis is a dissertation that contains the results of conducted experiments

## Question 2

**Case study**: The case study is hypothetical.&#x20;

Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) is a private tutoring company in South Africa that provides tutoring services to students who are enrolled for diplomas and degrees in Information Systems at various colleges and universities. In the past, ITS’s tutors have been using WhatsApp to communicate with their students, but the company has decided to consider other options due to concerns about WhatsApp’s new terms and conditions that will be implemented in 2021. ITS considers the following alternatives:

* Developing its own Africanized messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients
* Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localize the app for the South African market

Assume that you have been appointed by ITS as an HCI expert. Management has tasked you to do a user experience evaluation of Telegram as a possible alternative. ITS decides to adopt Telegram and you have to manage all aspects of interaction design (ID) related to the possible future enhancements or alternatives planned for the South African market

2.1 As an interaction designer, briefly describe interactive technologies that can be used to design the ITS app that is accessible and inclusive to meet the needs of the following group of users. Describe in point form the technologies per each group of users

| Users                                 | Technology Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blind users (persons that cannot see) | <ul><li>Text to speech should be utilized</li><li>Support braille typing</li><li>Option for an adjusted interface with no keyboard but instead large buttons for sending voice notes and speech-to-text functionality for sending texts</li></ul> |
| Deaf users (persons that cannot hear) | <ul><li>You can utilize the devices flash to indicate a notification has been received</li><li>Convert voice notes to text live</li><li>Auto-captions for video calls</li></ul>                                                                   |

2.2 There is a fine line between an interaction that works and that is usable. Designing interactions that work and are usable is achievable if design principles are appropriately applied. Discuss how you would apply the following principles when designing the ITS app

| Principle   | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visibility  | The more visible you make the functions, the more likely it is that the users will be able to know what to do next. |
| Feedback    | Sending feedback information to the user is vitally important                                                       |
| Constraints | You should restrict the users interactions dependent on context                                                     |
| Consistency | Design the interface to have similar operations and use similar elements to achieve similar tasks                   |
| Affordance  | Provide ways the user can infer how to use functions and know what they have access to                              |

2.3 As an interaction designer for ITS, you would need to collect some requirements from the stakeholders. Identify four stakeholders and list them in the following table

| Point | Stakeholder                      |
| ----- | -------------------------------- |
| 1     | The users of the application     |
| 2     | The investors of the application |
| 3     | Tutors                           |
| 4     | Developers of the application    |

2.4 What is the importance of involving users during the design of ITS? Identify at least 5 valid points and record them in the table below

| Point | Description of the point                                                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Developers gain a good understanding of user requirements                                               |
| 2     | Ensures that the final product is usable to the end users                                               |
| 3     | Manages the users’ expectations of the product                                                          |
| 4     | Users are more likely to support the product because of feelings of ownership due to involvement        |
| 5     | Ensures a more efficient development process where little backtracking due to useless ideas takes place |

2.5 During the design of the ITS app, how would you manage the expectations and ownership of the product by the stakeholders? Provide your answer in point form in the table below

| Point | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Involve stakeholders in the design process                                                                    |
| 2     | Adequate and timely training before the product is released                                                   |
| 3     | Clarify the expectations of the stakeholders so that everyone understands the requirements (use focus groups) |
| 4     | Provide regular updates throughout the development process                                                    |
| 5     | Host regular meetings with stakeholders to assess their satisfaction                                          |

## Question 3

3.1 What do you understand by the term "emotional interaction"?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

Emotional interaction is concerned with how we feel and react when interacting with technology. It covers different aspects of the user experience from how we feel when first finding out about a new product to getting rid of it. It also looks at why people become emotionally attached to certain products, how social robots might help reduce loneliness and how to change human behavior through the use of emotive feedback

3.2 From the components of the Anthony Ortony et al. (2005) model of emotional design, briefly explain how a wrist watch designed for teenage girls will invoke each of the components of the model. Provide your answer in the following table

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ne5EPeb.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

| Component      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Reflective | This refers to making a product look, feel and sound good. This is done by using bright colors and wild designs                                                                                        |
| 2 - Behavioral | This refers to the usability of a product. This is achieved by its affordances of use and a system that is widely used by other watches                                                                |
| 3 - Visceral   | This refers to the meaning and personal value of the product in a certain culture. This is achieved by using cultural imagery that reflect the environments that teenage girls regularly interact with |

3.3 You want to buy the above watch for your teenager. Assume that the watch has sports functions, including measuring heart rate and recording sport activities. You are concerned about the usability of the watch. List any four usability questions that you would ask before buying the watch in the following table?

| Point | Usability questions                                            |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | How clearly is the heart rate and sport information displayed? |
| 2     | How comfortable is the watch?                                  |
| 3     | How accurate is the heart rate monitor?                        |
| 4     | How long does the battery last?                                |

## Question 4

Interviews can be viewed as a conversation with a purpose between two or more people where questions are asked by the interviewer to get facts or clarity from the interviewee. Interviews are mostly used for requirements gathering during product design or for testing the usability of a product. In point form, describe the characteristics of structured interviews and focus groups in the following table

| Structured interview characteristics                                                                 | Focus group characteristics                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Predetermined questions are asked, and all participants get the same questions in the same order | 1 - Allows diverse and sensitive issues to be raised that could have otherwise been missed |
| 2 - Typically closed questions are asked                                                             | 2 - Usually a group led by a trained facilitator                                           |
| 3 - Only useful if the goals of the interview are clearly understood                                 | 3 - Participants are a representative sample of the target population                      |

## Question 5

Cognitive walkthroughs involve simulating a user’s problem-solving process at each step in the human computer dialog, checking to see if the user’s goals and memory can be assumed to lead to the next correct action. In point form, describe each of the five steps involved in cognitive walkthroughs

| Point | Description of cognitive walkthrough stage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Characteristics of typical users identified and documented. Sample tasks for the design being evaluated are developed. A description, mock-up or prototype of the interface is produced with a sequence of actions needed for users to complete the task                                                                                                                                     |
| 2     | A designer and one or more expert evaluators come together to do the analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3     | <p>Evaluators walk through action sequences for each task, placing it within the context of a typical scenario, and as they do this, they try to answer the following questions<br>- Will the user know what to do to achieve the task<br>- Will the user notice that the correct action is available <br>- Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly</p> |
| 4     | <p>As the walkthrough is being done, a record of critical information is compiled in which<br>- The assumptions about what would cause problems and why are identifiable<br>- Notes about side issues and design changes are made<br>- A summary of the results is compiled</p>                                                                                                              |
| 5     | The design is then revised to fix the problems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
