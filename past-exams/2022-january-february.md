## Question 1 (MCQ)

1.1 Which option is NOT a user-centered design principle?

1. Early Focus on users and tasks
2. Linear design
3. Empirical measurement using quantifiable and measurable usability criteria
4. Iterative design

1.2 Which statement regarding interaction design phases is correct?

1. Interaction design follows the common design phases of discovery, definition, development, and delivery in an intermittent way
2. Interaction design follows the common design phases of discovering, designing, prototyping, and evaluating in an intermittent way
3. Interaction design follows the common design phases of discovering, designing, prototyping and evaluating in an iterative way
4. Interaction design follows the common design phases of discovery, definition, development, and delivery in an iterative way

1.3 Assume that you have been contacted to do the interactive design for a local town's electronic library system. You have designed a non-functional collection of screens that demonstrate how a library user will lend a digital book. This activity is an example of

1. Visceral design
2. Designing alternatives
3. Prototyping
4. Establishing requirements

1.4 Integrating interaction design with an agile software development approach is useful because

1. An agile approach incorporates tight iterations, feedback and collaboration with the customer
2. By using an agile approach, developers can start coding immediately to save time and costs
3. An agile approach does not require that all critical design elements are captured in a design document
4. An agile approach requires all software development processes to be specified before development begins to ensure rigour

1.5 Virtual shopping carts, baskets, shelves, checkouts, cash registers, payment options and alternative online shopping techniques show

1. How future scenarios (visions) enable users to interact with information in their everyday lives
2. How conceptual models provide scenarios of how society can use future generations of imagined technologies
3. How theories help identify factors relevant to the design and evaluation of interactive products
4. How seemingly similar tasks can have quite different conceptual models and metaphors underlying their design&#x20;

1.6 People are inherently social. How have various digital technologies enabled us to overcome social distance, even while physical distancing measures have been in place during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown

1. Face-to-face meetings have been replaced to a large extent by online meetings using sound and video or sound only
2. Much informal verbal communication has been replaced by texting and using emojis
3. Creating, sending and forwarding humoristic video and sound clips have replaced the telling of jokes to relief stress and anxiety&#x20;
4. All of the above

1.7 Which statement is an advantage of focus groups regarding data gathering for interaction design?

1. It works well if there is a known set of possible answers
2. It works well if participants are in a rush
3. It is suitable to investigate community issues
4. It generates good statistical data

1.8 The developers of a new e-reader want to find out how appealing such a device would be to undergraduate students at Unisa. Which one of the following possible questions could be used in an unstructured interview to understand the appeal of using e-readers to the target group?

1. Would you like to read your INF3720 textbook using an e-reader? Answer yes or no
2. What do you like least about reading books on Google Scholar? Why?
3. In what format do you prefer to read books, and why?
4. In your opinion, on a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), are existing e-readers easy to handle?

1.9 Which type of evaluation study is suitable to study the appropriation of technology?

1. Conducting experiments
2. Field studies
3. Usability testing
4. Quantative research

1.10 Usability testing is usually done in:

1. Natural settings
2. The wild
3. Controlled settings
4. All three other options

## Question 2

**Case study**: The case study following below is hypothetical

Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) is a private tutoring company in South Africa that provides tutoring services to students who are enrolled for diplomas and degrees in Information Systems at various colleges and universities. In the past, ITS's tutors have been using WhatsApp to communicate with their students, but the company has decided to consider other options due to concerns about WhatsApp's new terms and conditions that will be implemented in 2021. ITS considers the following alternatives

* Developing its own Africanized messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients
* Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localize the app for the South African market

Assume that you have been appointed by Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) as an HCI expert. Management has tasked you to do a user experience evaluation of Telegram as a possible alternative. ITS decides to adopt Telegram and you have to manage all aspects of interaction design (ID) related to the possible future enhancement or alternatives planned for the South African market

## Question 5

The case study is hypothetical

The School of Computing (SoC) have a small library, which is not associated with the university's main library. The SoC library has a collection of Information Systems and Computer Science textbooks and journals. The library uses an Excel spreadsheet to manage the library. The challenge is that borrowers return books late or don't return them. The borrowers include students and all School of Computing staff. You have been approached by the SoC to design a system that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non-returned books are tracked

5.1 Identify three main functional requirements of the library information system application

5.2 Choose one of the functional requirements of the library system and present it as an atomic requirement by populating the Volere template below

5.3 Based on the functional requirement that you chose in the previous question, express it as a user story in the form of an epic

5.4 Assume that you successfully developed the Library information system application and you are concerned about the usability of the application. Discuss four aspects considered important for the good usability of the Library information system in the following table&#x20;

|   | Usability aspect |
| - | ---------------- |
| 1 |                  |
| 2 |                  |
